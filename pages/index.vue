          Welcome to D2 Arsenal, a tool to help you finding your desired weapon rolls for Destiny 2 and share them
          along.
          D2 Arsenal is the spiritual successor of D2 Gunsmith, which is sadly no longer maintained.
          While being still in early development, feature-parity is planned, as well as new features and UX
          improvements.
